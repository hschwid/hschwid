- 👋 Hi, I’m hschwid.
- 👀 I’m interested in medical simulation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Git, Ionic, Capacitor, AngularJS, and Android Studio. I am over-whelmed.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on adding AdMob and IAP to my VanillaJS app.
      I need help and I can pay!
- 📫 You can reach me at hschwid@anesoft.com.
